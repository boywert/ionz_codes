A simple set of codes to simulate (semi-\/numerically) H\+I maps during reionization.

Use the makefile for compilation in the following manner\+:

make ionz\+\_\+main

It will create the executable 'ionz\+\_\+main'

You need to install F\+F\+T\+W 2.\+x.\+x with following flags\+: '--enable-\/float' and '--enable-\/type-\/prefix' to compile this set of codes.
