ionz_codes
==========

A simple set of codes to simulate (semi-numerically) HI maps during reionization.

Use the makefile for compilation in the following manner:

make ionz_main

It will create the executable 'ionz_main'

You need to install FFTW 2.x.x with following flags: 
'--enable-float' and '--enable-type-prefix' 
to compile this set of codes.
